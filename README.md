# Bikeshare Data Analysis Project

## Date Created
June 20, 2025

## Project Title
Bikeshare Data Exploration with Python

## Description
This project allows users to explore data related to bike share systems in three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C.

The script is interactive: it asks the user to select a city and specify filters such as month and day. It then calculates and displays statistics on:

- Most frequent times of travel
- Most popular stations and trips
- Trip duration
- User demographics (gender, birth year, etc.)
- Raw data if requested

This project is part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

## Files Used
- `bikeshare.py`: The main Python script that runs the program.
- `chicago.csv`: Dataset for Chicago bikeshare.
- `new_york_city.csv`: Dataset for New York City bikeshare.
- `washington.csv`: Dataset for Washington D.C. bikeshare.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Software Required
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- time
- os

To install the required libraries:
